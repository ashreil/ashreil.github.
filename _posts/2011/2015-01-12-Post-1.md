## Welcome to **The Broken Motel**


This is my attempt at a static site, where I shall attempt to learn the system but also a platform for me to :

1. Place notes and scribblings and hopefully other media things

2. A simple place for me to just rant along

3. There are no hard and fast rules, its just simple stuff, a place to leave my 2 cents. 

I am a writer, photographer and now learning Film. I admit I know **nuts** about film, but I'm learning. 

I shoot, like my writing about awareness, mainly drug awareness. I am branching off to other areas, but I needed a platform to learn. I had not touched my camera in years. I am now getting back into the groove of things. 

    The work I do, is not to the liking of many, but to those that it does make a difference, I am glad it does for those of us with a *voice* - as I have learnt - shouldn't waste it. 

This is a first post which I will probably remove, as I am trying to learn the platform.
